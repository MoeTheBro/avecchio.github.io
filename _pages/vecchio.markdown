## Quick Bio
I was born and raised in Florida. In high school I joined the robotics team. I had two acceptance letters, one from Kettering University and the other from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University. I was also on the wait list for Virginia Tech. 

My first semester of college was the most difficult experience I had ever encountered. 

The year was 2014 and this was when my life began to turn around.
The first two weeks were interesting. 


My first job was an internship at the [MITRE](http://www.mitre.org/) as a co-op through Kettering. It lasted about two and a half years. My next job was [HelloWorld](http://www.helloworld.com/)
Below I have written stuff about First Robotics, Beta Theta Pi, and Kettering University as these organizations or institutions have driven me to become who I am today.
