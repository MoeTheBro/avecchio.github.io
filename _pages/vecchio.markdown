## Quick Bio

My first job was an internship at the [MITRE](http://www.mitre.org/) as a co-op through Kettering. It lasted about two and a half years. My next job was [HelloWorld](http://www.helloworld.com/)
Below I have written stuff about First Robotics, Beta Theta Pi, and Kettering University as these organizations or institutions have driven me to become who I am today.
