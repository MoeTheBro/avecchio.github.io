# Notes and Guidelines

### Keeping It Simple

A rule not usually followed by many. 

### Preseason

A preseason is highly recommended for all teams. 

Before I had the chance to work on a robot, 

### Swerve Drive (Crab)

There are multiple options that can be used within the drive train for first robotics. Arcade, tank, swerve drive, a combination of these systems. Using omni wheels, mechanum wheels, and ranging from three to eight wheels on a robot, a drive train is always unique.

The most complicated system in existance is the swerve drive by far. Any other system can be easily programmed, fine tuned and constructed quickly and with ease within a build season.

The only way that FRC Team 79 (Krunch) was able to succeed in the construction of a

### The Pits

The pits are 

One of the issues that has been found is the lack of internet. It would be a nice to have for ethernet drops throughout the pits so that firmware, code and documents can be retrieved from whatever repository the team is using. 

### Gracious Professionalism

This section is more of a rant. It is well known that FIRST is a robotics competition. Students, mentors, volunteers spend countless hours for these events to take place. It is tiring. I have been on each role at one point or another. I ask that while this is a competition, please keep the actual competitiveness out. It is nice to win. Overall, it does not really matter. The competition promotes the stimulation of STEM within high school students. In addition, to unite and promote the nerds among us. From programmers and internet enthusiests to electrical hobbyists. Taking what many have only tinkered with and drove it to something far more rewarding. And to meet thousands who share the same interest. So please, calm yourself. It is just a game. Have fun, and remember to dance to the Cotton Eyed Joe!

### Version Control

As a software engineer, 

### Resources

This is nitpicking, but it would be nice to have one account for all first robotic systems. From chief delphi, to google drive and even github. Anyone hear of omniauth? Or Onelogin?

### Team Utilization

There are many opportunities out there. From animation to chairmans. Have students dedicated to software, electrical, mechanical and systems teams for the robot. And unless some students wish to double up, have another separate group of students work on animations, documentation, chairmans, and other buisness related items.
