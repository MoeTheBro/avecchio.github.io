["I stand in the barren sands on the outskirts of a city. I remain mezmerized by the people that occupy such a place. I cannot imagine how they remain unaware of their own surroundings constantly blinding them by the lives they have lead. And yet they still get up out of bed. And even when you walk from your past. When your life is getting better and your troubles cease to exist. And yet they still remain to look over their shoulder as if in fear. And even though life goes on. You do not. You realize one terrible truth. That the reason you look over your shoulder is the same reason you cannot sleep at night. The same reason you are not able to move on. Your own past can exist as your own worst enemy. And although burried can rise from the ground on a nightly eve and strike upon your life with a thundering axe. It is your past that will haunt you. And even in the sunshine, your body still casts a shadow behind you. Darkness will forever exist in ones life. A paradox that not even belief nor hope can save. But yet I, an outcast by journey, always bounded and dead remained. But now I stand looking at a different perspective. I have seen the worst yet to come. It is the same reason I dare not enter the city. But now my journey is taking me down another road. And the sea of fire I once stood upon is now cooling into an ocean. Meeting new people I realize that I am different. Although my heartless soul remains. I now understand, that the man in the mirror has indeed changed. As a mathematical formula is constantly mutating. As if happiness, life, and love were all but variables in an equation. And now I begin to realize the inevitable as the sands of time constantly turns the table."]
