# Biography

My first job was an internship at the [MITRE](http://www.mitre.org/) as a co-op through Kettering. It lasted about two and a half years. My next job was [HelloWorld](http://www.helloworld.com/)
Below I have written stuff about First Robotics, Beta Theta Pi, and Kettering University as these organizations or institutions have driven me to become who I am today.

### [Beta Theta Pi](http://betathetapi.org)

There is much to say here, so I will start by saying a fraternity is not for everyone. Not only this, but fraternities area also evolving from their stereotype. When I say I am in a fraternity, the typical response is "TOGA! TOGA! TOGA!". When I respond, I explain that it is a dry house (strict no alcohol rule). Fraternities started out as social orders trying to better men as a brotherhood. Most of my friends from high school are in fraternities.

### [FIRST](http://usfirst.org)

#### At Work
Boss: So where is your robot?
Me: Uh... Sorry to disapoint you, but a six foot tall, 120 pound
robot is not that easy to take to work for show and tell..

#### FIRST Elevator Speech
FIRST (For inspiration and recognition of science and technology)

#### If you are not in FIRST, you are last!
My experience started out in high school when I joined FRC [Team 79 Krunch](http://www.teamkrunch.com/). I was shocked when Florida went from having one regional to two when we gained the South Florida regional in addition to the Orlando regional.

 and moved to [The Mech Warriors](http://team573.com)

### [Kettering University](http://kettering.edu)

Every college has its faults. And Kettering has many. I will say you will never find a college such as this.
